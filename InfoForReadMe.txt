What is a ScalarConverter?
In C++, a ScalarConverter typically refers to a utility that converts scalar values (like int, float, double, or char) between different types.

A scalar value is a single numerical value that represents a quantity, unlike vectors, arrays, or other complex data structures. Scalars are used in both mathematics and programming to describe single data points.

Difference Between Scalar and Non-Scalar Values
Scalar Values	Non-Scalar Values
Store a single value	Store multiple values
int, double, char, bool	Arrays, Vectors, Strings, Structs, Classes
Example: 42	Example: {1, 2, 3} (Array)
Can be processed in a single operation	Often require iteration for processing
